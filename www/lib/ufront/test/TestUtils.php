 * A set of functions to make it easier to mock and test various ufront classes and interfaces.
 * These helpers have been designed for use with static extension: `using ufront.test.TestUtils`.
 * When you use static extension in this way, `NaturalLanguageTests` and `Mockatoo` are also included for static extension.
 * The methods in `NaturalLanguageTests` are shortcuts to these methods, but named in a way to make your automated tests very readable when using static extension.
 * The requests are mocked using `MockHttpRequest` and `MockHttpResponse`.
 * Please note the `utest` library must be included for these methods to be available.
